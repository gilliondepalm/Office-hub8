# Kantoor Dashboard

## Overview
A comprehensive office dashboard application with 9 modules and granular permissions for managing office operations. Built with React/Express/PostgreSQL.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components
- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Auth**: Session-based authentication with bcrypt password hashing
- **Permissions**: Module-level access control via `permissions` text[] column on users

## Modules
1. **Dashboard** - Overview with stats, upcoming events, recent announcements, pending absences
2. **Evenementen Kalender** - Event management with categories (vergadering, training, sociaal, deadline)
3. **Aankondigingen** - Announcements with priority levels, pinning, PDF attachments, and direct messaging (admin/manager to employee with reply)
4. **Organisatie** - Department management with tabs: Afdelingen (department cards with manager info), AO-Procedures (admin-managed procedures with step-by-step instructions per department), Organogram (visual org chart), CAO Info (collective labor agreement overview), Wetgeving (legislation links grouped by category)
5. **Personalia** - Employee directory with roles and departments
6. **Verzuim** - Absence/leave management with approval workflow, BVVD (bijzonder verlof) with predefined reasons, vacation day balance tracking per employee, admin vacation day allowance management
7. **Beloningen** - Four sub-tabs: Functioneringsgesprekken (performance reviews with database storage and year-based filtering), Beoordelingsgesprekken (competency-based assessments where admin configures 5-6 competencies per functie with optional normering descriptions per score level 1-5, each scored 1-5 with auto-calculated total and average, functie dropdown populated from configured functies, competency dropdown with collapsible normering), Jaarplan (yearly planning per employee with afspraken/start/einde/voortgang/status tracking, grouped by employee with color-coded status badges), and Beloningssysteem (points-based rewards with leaderboard)
8. **Applicaties** - Application access management with user permissions
9. **Beheer** - Admin-only user permissions management (toggle module access per user)
10. **Mijn Profiel** - Personal profile page with own absences, rewards, and access overview

## Authentication & Permissions
- Session-based with PostgreSQL session store
- Demo credentials: admin/admin123, manager/user123, pieter/user123, sophie/user123, thomas/user123
- Roles: directeur, admin, manager, employee (different permissions per role)
- `isAdminRole()` helper from `@shared/schema` checks for both "directeur" and "admin" roles
- Directeur role has all admin privileges plus exclusive ability to approve manager/admin absence requests
- Admins can approve employee absences only; managers approve employees in their department only
- Module permissions stored as text[] on each user
- Default permissions: directeur/admin=all 9 modules, manager=8 (no beheer), employee=5 (dashboard, kalender, aankondigingen, verzuim, beloningen)
- Sidebar navigation filtered by user.permissions
- Routes conditionally rendered based on permissions (unauthorized URLs show 404)
